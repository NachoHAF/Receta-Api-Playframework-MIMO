Comparando con los requistos de evaluacion, he intentado todos, excepto Composici√≥n de acciones, y me parece que los he logrado terminar con exito.



# Play Receta API para Master MIMO

Prerequisites include:

* Java Software Developer's Kit (SE) 1.8 or higher
* sbt 0.13.15 or higher (we recommend 1.2.3) Note: if you downloaded this project as a zip file from https://developer.lightbend.com, the file includes an sbt distribution for your convenience.

To check your Java version, enter the following in a command window:

`java -version`

To check your sbt version, enter the following in a command window:

`sbt sbtVersion`

If you do not have the required versions, follow these links to obtain them:

* [Java SE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)

## Build and run the project

To build and run the project:

1. Use a command window to change into the project directory, for example: `cd Receta-api`

2. Build the project. Enter: `sbt run`. The project builds and starts the embedded HTTP server. Since this downloads libraries and dependencies, the amount of time required depends partly on your connection's speed.

3. After the message `Server started, ...` displays, enter the following URL in a browser: <http://localhost:9000>

The Play application responds: `MIMO-Receta-Api`
